## Setup

### Pre requisites

Install node
Install volta
Install docker

### Volta

Next, make sure you have installed [volta](http://volta.sh/) which ensures you have the right version of node and yarn for this project. You can run:

```
volta install node
```

and then:

```
volta install yarn
```

To get the right versions for this repo.

We also strongly recommend the use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an authoring tool. If you use something else, you're on your own. and chances are that you can affect the rest of the team

Volta explains that it is possible to use volta with nvm in case you use nvm in other workspaces that you have. I you run into trouble with volta and nvm just comment the following line in your .zshrc or bash_profile file

```
# export PATH="$VOLTA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

Do not forget to remove the comment when you want to work in this repo

### Run Docker

On the command line run

```
docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

Run a terminal to access the db

```
psql -U postgres
postgres-# CREATE DATABASE mytest;
postgres-# \q
```

Once docker is running and have a schema lets install node dependencies

### Node

On the repository run

```
yarn
```

this should install all dependencies

later on run

```
yarn initial-prisma
```

this should create the schema and seed a super user in the database

the users create should be

```
email: 'admin@admin.com',
password: 'password',

email: 'user@user.com',
password: 'password',
```
